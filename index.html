<blockquote>
    <p>minister of agriculture said that " I am glad to have noted that this technology is providing solutions for crop protections and we are in discussion with our partners to get these at the farmersâ€™ hands. We have seen that food shortage during COVID lockdowns reached unconventional audience including some of us in the room.  
        I have spoken to wealthy friends from wealthy countries who were worried about the survivals of their young families, we see middle income families worried now 
        by how much their pockets are being drained by the food prices.  "</p>
